## Recent activity

- Ingested **Building pi in a World of Slop — Mario Zechner** (2026-05-03). AI Engineer talk tying [[pi-agent]] to a broader warning about agent-generated slop. Key points: harnesses can silently take ownership of context, pi favors a tiny self-modifying extension core, clanker PR/issue spam drains OSS maintainer attention, and critical agent-written code still has to be read line by line by humans.
- Ingested **JRT Investment — I Don't Give a Fuck Skill** (2026-05-02). Thai Facebook post reframing "I don't give a fuck" as **Care Allocation**: attention/care is a scarce resource, so the skill is choosing what deserves it. Key points: ignore low-value internet judgment, care about work and meaningful people, reduce mental load, lower the perceived cost of failure, and decide faster.
- Ingested **thClaws Marketplace / มาร์เก็ตเพลสสำหรับ thClaws** (2026-04-30). Panutat Tejasen announces thClaws v0.7.0 with a Marketplace for Skills, MCP, and Plugins. Key highlights: **Enterprise Security** via Private Marketplaces, the **Host Bridge** concept for **Agent Dashboards** (inspired by Claude Cowork), and the **Rabbit Hole** phenomenon in complex coding tasks.
- Ingested **Andrej Karpathy: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering** (2026-04-30). Karpathy explores the transition from **Vibe Coding** (raising the floor) to **Agentic Engineering** (raising the ceiling/discipline). He introduces **Software 3.0** (programming by prompting/context window), **Jagged Intelligence** (AI peaks in verifiable tasks but valleys in common sense), and the need for **Agent-Native Infrastructure** (docs/APIs designed for agents).
- Ingested **The Harness Is the Backend** (2026-04-29). @mfpiccolo introduces the **iii (Triple I)** framework and the **WTF Primitives** (Worker-Trigger-Function). Argues that agent infrastructure (harness) should not be extrinsic but should use the same primitives as traditional backends. Key features: **Agent as a Worker**, **Live Discovery/Extensibility**, and **Unified Observability**.
- Ingested **Compound Engineering - 4/28/2026** (2026-04-29). Trevin (Every Inc.) announces v3.3.0 of the **Compound Engineering** skill suite. Focuses on making agents **Cheaper to Correct** through the **Playback Pattern** (Stated, Inferred, Out-of-scope) and preventing hallucination via **Grounding** ideas in code evidence. Also addresses reducing "ceremony" by automating obvious agent fixes.
- Ingested **Why Karpathy’s Second Brain Breaks at Agent Scale. How Mercury Solves It.** (2026-04-28). @Ctrl_Alt_Zaid analyzes why human-centric wikis fail for autonomous agents. Proposes **Hybrid Memory Architecture** (Markdown for humans, Structured substrate for agents) and introduces the **Mercury** project. Key concepts: **Memory Drift**, **Selective Injection**, **Memory Scoring**, and **Memory Decay**.
- Ingested **ทำไม AI ช่วยให้เขียนโค้ดเร็วขึ้น 10 เท่า แต่โปรเจกต์ยังเสร็จช้าเท่าเดิม?** (2026-04-28). Jeeraphan Lairat (Senestia) explores why AI coding speed doesn't translate to faster delivery if bottlenecks (waiting for reviews/tests) aren't addressed. Key concepts: **Theory of Constraints**, **Local Optimization Trap**, **Lead Time**, **Shift-Left Testing**, and **Limit WIP**.
