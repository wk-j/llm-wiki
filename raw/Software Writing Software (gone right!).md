## Transcript

**0:00** · I got to give a talk on what I I would not really call a joke, instead I would call a thought experiment. And that thought experiment was what would things look like if you could sort of materialize software, or at least maybe materialize like just a little function from just describing it. Obviously, you know, with LLMs, people are doing big agentic coding things. I've tried a lot of that. I think there's lots of pros and cons. But I was wondering about something a little bit more targeted.

**0:26** · You're writing a function, you're writing a file, you're implementing something. And there's just a little piece that you don't need to write, uh, but you want the AI to kind of put in place for you. So, I hope you enjoy the talk. After the talk is done, stick around. We'll we'll do some technical deep dives together. See you. All right, so today I'm going to do a little live demo, but just a little bit of, uh, introduction before we get there. Uh, a little while ago I kind of had this idea of called PDE, this personalized development environment.

**0:56** · And I've been sort of talking about this for a little while. Uh, for me, Neovim has always been part of this experience, but it extends beyond just your editor. And it it doesn't have to be Neovim. I One of the things I talk about is like Emacs, you can have this. You can have this even in JetBrains or whatever. But the idea is about crafting an environment that you understand well, that you can

**1:17** · eliminate a lot of the annoyances, the things that maybe you know you need to get done today, and you know it's only going to take 30 seconds, but it really bothers you, so you wait 3 days before you get it done. Right? Can you eliminate those things? At least that's how my, uh, developer brain works, right? And so the idea is about eliminating those and creating something that you're excited about, that you like, and that works for you. I resonated a lot with, uh, DHH's talk earlier.

**1:44** · Initially, this was sort of this idea that there's something kind of in between like a text editor and an IDE, right? There's something that you bring a little bit of your own, uh, assembly required, a little bit of an IKEA style to, uh, your development environment, right? For me, what's been kind of interesting in the past few months has been exploring, you know, where does this change now to?

**2:05** · And there's there's something here about not just that you can do this, but that you make a system where you're encouraged to be exploring this, encouraged to being able to make it your own, right? That it's not 37 clicks inside of a menu is the only way to export your config so that you can load it again on another system, right?

**2:25** · And you know, tons of different ways that you can do this.

**2:28** · But I find now actually more and more of my computer I'm able to customize. I'm able to make my own. I'm able to explore and the cost of some of those at least experimenting with that is a lot lower than it feels like what it used to be before, right? Uh I have this all the time now with Linux troubleshooting. As we were setting up some stuff, uh there were some people who were typing some commands, getting getting everything working with Omachi on here. I said, "Guys, your agent can solve that for you, right? Uh at least give it a shot. At least tell it, 'Hey, the big monitor not work.

**2:59** · Can fix, please?' And it's like, 'Yeah, sure.' Oh, and it didn't first time I plugged it in, I had little bars right here. You know what I'm saying? I said, 'It's not filling the whole screen. I have a different aspect ratio. Can you fix that?' No problem. Instantly, right?

**3:14** · I have this a lot with Omachi configuration. I just got this laptop like last week. Everything that I did was I I did on the plane basically here a bunch of it. I rewrote my entire Neovim config to explore this. I did a bunch of other stuff. Just to explore like how far can I push this? What can we do? Um and some things like that. Uh I actually thought about doing this talk with a project called dot prompts.

**3:37** · Instead of your dot files, it's just a list of changes that I don't like that DHH picked for Omachi \[laughter\] and saving them and then just applying them live. Uh it seemed like it was going to take too long, but uh but I do like this concept of now I have dot prompts instead of dot files.

**3:53** · And sort of this idea of making personal software. So, I I have a quick demo to sort of explore some of these ideas here where we can do this. I wrote a little plug-in a while ago that I called Oh, let me set this to marker. Awesome.

**4:10** · That I that I called Louie. It's Lua plus AI together, Louie. And and the idea here is often times, especially like for Neovim, but you can extend this to any other thing or cool raffle based language, whatever you want to do. You have the ability, right, to describe the kind of thing that you want to do.

**4:30** · And it's sometimes very simple. So, you know, an example here that we have is just something like, "I want to print all the odd values in the table."

**4:39** · Now, that's pretty easy to do in Lua, nothing too exciting.

**4:43** · But, we can run this and what happens here actually is if this file if this file doesn't exist on my system here in the runtime path for Neovim, it actually just calls Oh, here we go. Nice. It's done. It calls a little agent, generates the file if it's not there, and then saves it for me, puts it into the runtime path. What happens now though is since I've done that once, there's no reason not to have it saved again. So, when I execute the file, it just runs right away, right?

**5:11** · And we actually save this as print all odd values in the table.

**5:15** · I save some extra information here because I'll show you at the end we can improve it and we can explore iterating on on the project. But, right it You know what? Yeah.

**5:24** · Sure enough, that's how you determine if something's odd. You don't actually have to install an NPM package for that. But, what what else can we do here? Right, we can do anything we sort of want. A lot of these kinds of problems where you maybe don't really want to write them, you know, we can start doing Oh, here, let me We'll scroll a little bit more so that's in the center of the page.

**5:44** · Um like remove multiple white spaces from string anywhere in text.

**5:50** · Right?

**5:51** · If I if I want to do that, right? We can just execute this one again and this we we don't have this function here locally and we can explore doing this and and writing kind of almost this idea of like just-in-time software.

**6:05** · \[laughter\] Right? Where I'm getting the software just when I need it and it can do the thing that that I want to do. And hopefully my internet's good enough to actually get get the response back for this. I was like, "Oh, I've got to Okay, cool. Nice." Sweet.

**6:20** · Start hello world, right? So you can see here we eliminated the extra spaces between hello and world and there were multiple spaces. Right? Is is almost like this idea of just-in-time software. If it works, great. I just keep it. If if I don't want it, I can throw it away.

**6:34** · Something that's very fun that I've been enjoying a lot is it knows how to do Neovim. Right? If if you want to do something where you say, "Hey, create a floating window." I added a little sort of like bonus prompt action here where you can write a description and it will pass that as additional context to the LLM to generate it. And so if we want to create a floating window, right? Maybe you're just exploring Neovim. You don't want to read NVIM open win and the I don't know.

**7:02** · Maria, you got to guess about how many words are in NVIM open win config. It's a lot. There's a lot of word Oh, no! Invalid key win highlight. Oh, I'm on too new of a Neovim.

**7:11** · Oh, perfect timing actually. I didn't actually plan this, but we can say uh let's do create voting window. Hey, win highlight is deprecated. Don't do that. Okay. And um right So so this this was an example of something where like you sometimes get the error. You just need to tell it one extra thing. I'm on a newer version of Neovim. That that thing doesn't exist anymore. Whatever, right? It says, "Okay, cool. Wrote the updated file.

**7:37** · Let's try running it now." Boom. Nice. That's personal software, baby. It's personal software. I could not have scripted that better. You like that's good. I like that. Okay, what else can we do? Well, it knows plugins. You know, like hey, I I know I've got telescope. I know telescope's installed.

**7:56** · Uh I don't know how to do something. I want to search my Neovim config. I don't know the exact command how to do that. I don't know what to do to start with, but we can run that. And then now this will write its own thing and like most of these plugins it knows the stuff that you already wanted to do. It knows what you're trying to get done.

**8:13** · Right? And so this will hopefully run something that just it just passes the current working directory to telescope. It's not that exciting, but it's fun that you can describe the thing that you want and it like magically pops out, right? And then the next time that you want to run this you don't have to wait around for the LLM to decide what to do.

**8:32** · You can just execute the same code again. Oh, no, it was there already. Maybe it just didn't update. Hello. Oh, nice. There we go. So now it's searching everything inside of my initial Neovim config, right? If I search for function, I didn't type that right. Well, we got this eventually. There we go. Right? These are all things inside of my Neovim config folder, right? So search in my Neovim config, boom, it does that. That's great.

**8:56** · But it can do even more than Neovim. This is where oops where I was thinking kind of this would be fun as well is we can even do some fun Omachi things.

**9:06** · Right now I'm in matte black, so that will not be exciting. But we can run this and say, "Hey, if I wanted to control Omachi from within my Neovim, right? Or I wanted to go do something different. I want to completely change my theme or completely do whatever. I can control anything I want from in here and it will instantly switch my Omachi theme, right?"

**9:26** · There's So and then if we want to switch this back to matte black then we get we get that back again, right? So what's fun is you know, you can go and check and it's not, you know, it's not it's not crazy. It just runs Omachi theme set. But, the the thing that has been fun about thinking about this idea is it's very is very similar to how can we not have a wall, right, from getting to this looks kind of cool, but it's not mine.

**9:52** · How How can you think about using, you know, AI or whatever tools or maybe you're making a tool that uses AI to help people do this or I don't care. Doesn't have to be with AI, but it's whatever, right? How can we make it so that I can I can do a simple thing and it's actually simple to do. And then, how can I make it just for me the way that I want to do? If I want to control Neovim or I want to control all my Omachi themes. If I want to say, "Hey, let's also, I don't know, get the next Omachi background." Right? I should be able to do that from within Neovim.

**10:22** · And what's cool about, you know, Linux, whether that's on Omachi or not, is just this ability that your whole system, right, can be controlled programmatically. It's like this magic of touching the computer and like when you type something in the computer, something magical comes out and it's so crazy, right? That like now, oh, let's see, did it do it? I think it did, right? That's a different one. That's a different one than before.

**10:45** · Yep, that's a different one than before. That's You know, it's that's so cool. We could just change a background. We could script anything with either. I could check anything we want. So, that's that's kind of the the thing. And, you know, the interesting thing as well for Linux, right, is uh we can go ahead and write another one here, luaai.demo, and let's say open floating terminal SSH to terminal.shop.

**11:10** · Right? Uh if you don't know, you can buy coffee in the terminal. It's pretty cool. But, scripting anything you want inside of your environment, personalizing it just to you. The The cost of that is getting so much smaller.

**11:22** · Even if I wouldn't necessarily, you know, ship this to a bunch of other people that I have to do something like this, right? I can just open up an SSH floating window from Neovim to connect to a coffee-based SSH e-commerce store, right? Like what you like what you need to do every day, of course, very relatable. But, the point is it's it's whatever you want to do. And the point of my talk is hopefully you just realize and you're willing to explore the kinds of things that are in your life, right?

**11:52** · That you could just make a little bit easier every day. Cuz the cool thing about making something like just 1% better like every day or every week is that's a lot of percents by the end of the year. I don't know how many cuz it depends if you're doing compounding or not, but uh I'm I mean I'm not not a 100X engineer. I know that's Prime's favorite thing.

**12:11** · Um right? But but just thinking about that and looking for those and recognizing about the cost of those changes is just so different now.

**12:20** · Exploring that for yourself, um not waiting for someone to tell you that you're allowed to change your system or that you're allowed to do this or that there's nothing worth changing or working or pursuing on anymore, but instead like you can kind of just do magic. You can describe something with the name of a function.

**12:37** · It's like \[laughter and gasps\] I I we just wrote the name of the function and we use that to generate a new function and commit that action live. That's what I want to encourage you all to explore and think about and try out and that's, you know, I think probably why we're all here and what we're excited about. So, that's uh that's the end of my talk. So, that's thank you. Um Cool talk, dude.

**13:02** · \[applause and cheering\] Wow, truly incredible. Am I right, guys?

**13:08** · Am I right? Leave a clap in the comments. Wow, great talk. Anyways, okay. Let's get down to business. As I said, I'll give you a little bit more of a technical deep dive on what's going on inside of the project. In a lot of ways it's not super crazy complicated. It does a lot of very simple things, but it does sort of roughly abuse a few ideas inside of Lua.

**13:30** · So, the the main aspect here is we have this module here that it pretty much what it does is it just tries to coordinate the creation and uh loading of the different modules that we're making. Cuz, if you recall from the talk, the first time we run a function, it will gen go and generate that from the LLM. But, the second time it will reuse the code that we already have, right? So, that requires a little bit of shenanigans uh inside of Neovim.

**14:00** · You you might have noticed, too, if we hop over to our test, we we did some stuff here where we said some things like demand inside of require. I thought that was clever.

**14:12** · Whatever. So, what does demand do?

**14:14** · Basically, demand says, "Instead of putting a normal like module uh in this spot, you have a special module." So, if we go to our demo init module, what does it do? It says, "Hey, uh we don't actually have the code for these functions here. What we need to do instead is say, 'Let's load Let's require some initial initialization from Lua AI, right?'" And so, what does that do? It uses metatables. Now, that might scare some of you because you're thinking, "Metatables? What?

**14:45** · Does it spy on you?"

**14:49** · \[laughter\] \[sighs\] Um no, metatables are the thing that Lua does to implement sort of more class-like or advanced table features, okay? So, really, I would say like 90% of this plugin really comes down to this little spot here, which says, "Hey, it has an index field." Index only gets called if the table doesn't have this key. So, this table has no keys, we can see that right there.

**15:20** · So, what are we going to do? It says, "Hey, uh can we find this function that already exists?"

**15:27** · So, it literally just tries to require out whatever the module and key is that we have. So, if we went back to our demo idea here, right, and we went and looked at this, this is in that lua ai.demo.

**15:41** · And that's going to be this change or machi theme or create floating window or open a new window and say, the things that I was showing in the demo, those all just get required. And if it already exists, then it just says, "Cool, cool.

**15:57** · Let's just return that function. No problem at all. That's easy peasy, okay?" What does this thing look like?

**16:03** · You may notice, "Ooh, there's kind of some weird stuff going on." We're going to come back to what the actual function looks like in a second, but let's show you what we do if it doesn't exist. So, what does it do here? It says, "Okay, we're going to have a new function cuz it's a little bit lazy that way." And it tries to find where the module is that we're going to place it. That's no big deal. And then it just calls generate new function and store new function.

**16:25** · Generate new function, not that exciting either, guys. And then what it does is it takes those inputs, the prompts that we have there, and then it runs uh for me I've got it set up with cursor agent, but you could easily do this like Claude or Codex or local models or whatever you wanted. And then it just tries to generate and save the new function definition with sort of um two little tricks, okay? Two little tricks inside of there. So, it just calls something, it just executes this with um with an implementation. It calls calls the AI etc. blah blah blah.

**16:56** · That part's not that cool. It's just it's just text, guys. Remember, code is just text. So, you ask the LLM, "Hey, LLM, return back to me only lua code. Don't write anything else. I'm going to drop this into something." And we just drop it into the function. The only, I would say, sort of big like trick part here that's pretty fun, If we go back to the create floating window, which I think this is the one that we did. Beautiful.

**17:23** · This is the one that we had in the demo.

**17:25** · Um what we've got going on here is you'll see here's just a bunch of Lua code. It just does the things you expect. Creates a new buffer, sets the lines for whatever the content was, sets the file type if it has one, a background, and then calculates whether we can open it or not. The first trick is that it has its own metatable. This metatable, instead of using the index uh key or keyword or value, um it's just a key in a table. So, there's nothing special about it, but they're kind of like keywords in the sense they each have their own behavior. Whatever. You guys know what I'm saying. This one, instead of using index, uses call.

**17:54** · So, this just says, "Hey, treat this thing, if you call it like a function, what do you want me to do?" If you don't provide this, it will error. You can't just call random tables. That doesn't work. But, if you provide this, then it will act just like a regular function. So, the trick is for this, it has its implementation right here, which returns a new function. So, we can return that function and then pass the arguments in from whatever the call site is.

**18:22** · So, this is how we get that bonus table and whatever other args we are trying to pass to it. So, that's trick number one, and I promised two tricks, and of course, I'm going to deliver. The second trick is we store just a wee bit of JSON in this bad boy, okay? We just store a little bit of JSON encoded into the history. And why do we do that? That's so, when we want to do something like improve the function, when we had the error where win highlight didn't work, right? You can see right here, we said, "Hey, win highlight's deprecated.

**18:53** · Don't do that." We save the history of those things, so that if we want to update something and just make it do like a little bit different, we don't have to re-describe the whole problem. That's how we have that little pop-up uh that selects over them. And then it just says, "Cool, cool, cool. I'll read back the initial file. It's a table." It's a table, you got to remember that.

**19:15** · So, since it's a table, we can read back this info, we can parse it all out, we can reuse it, send it over to the LLM, the LLM sends us back updated code, we save the responses right here, and then we put the new implementation down at the bottom. Because we're using index, it's going to reload that guy and retry again. So, that's really easy, we can update that live. And there you go.

**19:39** · That's pretty much the majority of what's going on in the code. I think I have this public somewhere. I'll try and push it and put a link in the in the description for this. So, you can look for that later if you want.

**19:52** · If you got another question or wanted me to explain something else, let me know in the comments. I'll try and check those out and reply. And so, yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Obviously, we mentioned earlier before in some of the vlogs from Terminal and everything. Huge shout out to Dell. Thank you, Dell.

**20:07** · I love this XPS, been using it a lot, and they sponsored the conference and sponsored us to go there and do a bunch of work on making it happen and doing some planning and everything else. So, really appreciate Dell and really been enjoying this XPS. I think that's pretty much it, everybody. I hope you enjoy the video, and I will see you guys all in the next one. Bye-bye.
