Our latest model, Claude Opus 4.7, is now generally available.

Opus 4.7 is a notable improvement on Opus 4.6 in advanced software engineering, with particular gains on the most difficult tasks. Users report being able to hand off their hardest coding work—the kind that previously needed close supervision—to Opus 4.7 with confidence. Opus 4.7 handles complex, long-running tasks with rigor and consistency, pays precise attention to instructions, and devises ways to verify its own outputs before reporting back.

The model also has substantially better vision: it can see images in greater resolution. It’s more tasteful and creative when completing professional tasks, producing higher-quality interfaces, slides, and docs. And—although it is less broadly capable than our most powerful model, Claude Mythos Preview—it shows better results than Opus 4.6 across a range of benchmarks:

Last week we announced [Project Glasswing](https://www.anthropic.com/glasswing), highlighting the risks—and benefits—of AI models for cybersecurity. We stated that we would keep Claude Mythos Preview’s release limited and test new cyber safeguards on less capable models first. Opus 4.7 is the first such model: its cyber capabilities are not as advanced as those of Mythos Preview (indeed, during its training we experimented with efforts to differentially reduce these capabilities). We are releasing Opus 4.7 with safeguards that automatically detect and block requests that indicate prohibited or high-risk cybersecurity uses. What we learn from the real-world deployment of these safeguards will help us work towards our eventual goal of a broad release of Mythos-class models.

Security professionals who wish to use Opus 4.7 for legitimate cybersecurity purposes (such as vulnerability research, penetration testing, and red-teaming) are invited to join our new [Cyber Verification Program](https://claude.com/form/cyber-use-case).

Opus 4.7 is available today across all Claude products and our API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry. Pricing remains the same as Opus 4.6: $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens. Developers can use `claude-opus-4-7` via the [Claude API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

## Testing Claude Opus 4.7

Claude Opus 4.7 has garnered strong feedback from our early-access testers:

01 / 28

Below are some highlights and notes from our early testing of Opus 4.7:

- *Instruction following*. Opus 4.7 is substantially better at following instructions. Interestingly, this means that prompts written for earlier models can sometimes now produce unexpected results: where previous models interpreted instructions loosely or skipped parts entirely, Opus 4.7 takes the instructions literally. Users should re-tune their prompts and harnesses accordingly.
- *Improved multimodal support*. Opus 4.7 has better vision for high-resolution images: it can accept images up to 2,576 pixels on the long edge (~3.75 megapixels), more than three times as many as prior Claude models. This opens up a wealth of multimodal uses that depend on fine visual detail: computer-use agents reading dense screenshots, data extractions from complex diagrams, and work that needs pixel-perfect references.<sup>1</sup>
- *Real-world work*. As well as its state-of-the-art score on the Finance Agent evaluation (see table above), our internal testing showed Opus 4.7 to be a more effective finance analyst than Opus 4.6, producing rigorous analyses and models, more professional presentations, and tighter integration across tasks. Opus 4.7 is also state-of-the-art on [GDPval-AA](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa), a third-party evaluation of economically valuable knowledge work across finance, legal, and other domains.
- *Memory*. Opus 4.7 is better at using file system-based memory. It remembers important notes across long, multi-session work, and uses them to move on to new tasks that, as a result, need less up-front context.

The charts below display more evaluation results from our pre-release testing, across a range of different domains:

## Safety and alignment

Overall, Opus 4.7 shows a similar safety profile to Opus 4.6: our evaluations show low rates of concerning behavior such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse. On some measures, such as honesty and resistance to malicious “prompt injection” attacks, Opus 4.7 is an improvement on Opus 4.6; in others (such as its tendency to give overly detailed harm-reduction advice on controlled substances), Opus 4.7 is modestly weaker. Our alignment assessment concluded that the model is “largely well-aligned and trustworthy, though not fully ideal in its behavior”. Note that Mythos Preview remains the best-aligned model we’ve trained according to our evaluations. Our safety evaluations are discussed in full in the [Claude Opus 4.7 System Card](https://anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-7-system-card).

Overall misaligned behavior score from our automated behavioral audit. On this evaluation, Opus 4.7 is a modest improvement on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, but Mythos Preview still shows the lowest rates of misaligned behavior.

## Also launching today

In addition to Claude Opus 4.7 itself, we’re launching the following updates:

- *More effort control*: Opus 4.7 introduces a new `xhigh` (“extra high”) [effort level](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) between `high` and `max`, giving users finer control over the tradeoff between reasoning and latency on hard problems. In Claude Code, we’ve raised the default effort level to `xhigh` for all plans. When testing Opus 4.7 for coding and agentic use cases, we recommend starting with `high` or `xhigh` effort.
- *On the Claude Platform (API)*: as well as support for higher-resolution images, we’re also launching task budgets in public beta, giving developers a way to guide Claude’s token spend so it can prioritize work across longer runs.
- *In Claude Code*: The new `/ultrareview` [slash command](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands) produces a dedicated review session that reads through changes and flags bugs and design issues that a careful reviewer would catch. We’re giving Pro and Max Claude Code users three free ultrareviews to try it out. In addition, we’ve extended [auto mode](https://claude.com/blog/auto-mode) to Max users. Auto mode is a new permissions option where Claude makes decisions on your behalf, meaning that you can run longer tasks with fewer interruptions—and with less risk than if you had chosen to skip all permissions.

## Migrating from Opus 4.6 to Opus 4.7

Opus 4.7 is a direct upgrade to Opus 4.6, but two changes are worth planning for because they affect token usage. First, Opus 4.7 uses an updated tokenizer that improves how the model processes text. The tradeoff is that the same input can map to more tokens—roughly 1.0–1.35× depending on the content type. Second, Opus 4.7 thinks more at higher effort levels, particularly on later turns in agentic settings. This improves its reliability on hard problems, but it does mean it produces more output tokens.

Users can control token usage in various ways: by using the effort parameter, adjusting their task budgets, or prompting the model to be more concise. In our own testing, the net effect is favorable—token usage across all effort levels is improved on an internal coding evaluation, as shown below—but we recommend measuring the difference on real traffic. We’ve written a [migration guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide#migrating-to-claude-opus-4-7) that provides further advice on upgrading from Opus 4.6 to Opus 4.7.

![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fff97ab0f2a5f3a243da02398f97dec1ac99b526a-3840x2160.png&w=3840&q=75)

Score on an internal agentic coding evaluation as a function of token usage at each effort level. In this evaluation, the model works autonomously from a single user prompt, and results may not be representative of token usage in interactive coding. See the migration guide for more on tuning effort levels.

#### Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> This is a [model-level change](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) rather than an API parameter, so images users send to Claude will simply be processed at higher fidelity. Because higher-resolution images consume more tokens, users who don’t require the extra detail can downsample images before sending them to the model.

- For GPT-5.4 and Gemini 3.1 Pro, we compared against the best reported model version available via API in the charts and table.
