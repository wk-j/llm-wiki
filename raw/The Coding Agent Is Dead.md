The current generation of coding agents is dead. The heart is still beating, yes, but the bullet has already left the chamber. This generation isn't the future.

With [the newest models](https://ampcode.com/news/gpt-5.3-codex), the agent — the prompts and tools you wrap around a model — is no longer the limiting factor. These models can be powerful with nearly any tool you throw at them. A simple tool called `bash` is often enough. Whether you show LSP diagnostics here or there is dwarfed by what these models can do through sheer brute force. As long as it mostly gets out of the way, nearly any agent can get good results out of them. These new models barely need to be told how to act like coding agents anymore. They're now fully trained for that.

How you organize your codebase for agents, how your organization uses them — those are now the bottlenecks.

The frontier has shifted. And we're going to make massive changes to Amp so it stays on the frontier.

It's tempting not to. Amp is growing faster than ever. We could stay, keep things as they are, pretend that the coding agents of February 2026 are the final form and watch the numbers go up. We could say yes to more VC money and sell $2,000 worth of tokens for $20 a month.

But what would that buy us? A local maximum. And while we're sitting on top of the local maximum, each new model generation would move the frontier further and further into the distance. And the longer we keep things the same, the more we select for users that aren't comfortable at the frontier. But the users we want and need are those who are willing to pack up and travel light with us.

So, Amp has to evolve.

First step: we're going to kill the Amp editor extensions for VS Code and Cursor. We're unshackling these models from the editor.

By keeping these new models in an editor sidebar, we restrict them. They're now much more than mere assistants. They no longer need the hand-holding and really want to kick off their training wheels. They want to write code and run even when you're not sitting in front of your editor. It's time to see what they can do without supervision.

**The Amp editor extensions will self-destruct on March 5 at 8pm Pacific Time. Time to switch to the Amp CLI.**

Because we're keeping the CLI, for now. Its heart is still beating and it helps us get to where we need to go. Think of it as a ladder: we use it to climb up to the next level and then we might not need it. It's flexible, light, easy to change, can be run anywhere and anytime. It attracts the kind of users we're building for.

For those of you who read "everything is changing" on [our landing page back in April 2025](https://ampcode.com/april-2025) and nodded, this is nothing new. Our only promise was that when the frontier moved, we would move too.

If you're new to Amp: welcome. Come with us. Today Amp ceases to be a coding agent. It's no longer a point on a map. It's an arrow. Not a stop, but a ride.

And it might self-destruct too.

The extension has self-destructed.
