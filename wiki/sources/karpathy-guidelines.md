# Karpathy Guidelines (Claude Code skill)

A Claude Code skill (`karpathy-guidelines`) published by [[forrestchang]] that packages [[andrej-karpathy]]'s [observations on LLM coding pitfalls](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) into a single `SKILL.md` of behavioral rules. MIT-licensed, lives in the `forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills` repo.

Framed as a tradeoff: **bias toward caution over speed**. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## The four principles

### 1. Think Before Coding

*Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.*

- State assumptions explicitly; ask if uncertain.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

*Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.*

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Test: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"

### 3. Surgical Changes

*Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.*

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Flag unrelated dead code; don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables made unused by *your* changes. Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

*Define success criteria. Loop until verified.*

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with per-step verification. Strong success criteria let the LLM loop independently; weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Relationship to other Karpathy work

Same author as the [[llm-knowledge-bases]] pattern. That thread was about LLMs **manipulating knowledge**; these guidelines are about LLMs **manipulating code**. Both prescribe lightweight schemas (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `SKILL.md`) that steer LLM behavior through a shared instruction file rather than tooling.
